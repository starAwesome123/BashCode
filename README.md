# 🐧 Bash Scripting Samples

This repository contains simple Bash scripts that demonstrate fundamental shell scripting skills.  
It’s intended as a sample of my work with Linux shell scripting, showing how I use Bash for automation, system tasks, and basic command-line utilities.

## 📁 Contents

- **HelloBash.sh** – A basic script that prints a greeting, shows the current user and working directory, lists files, and displays the current date and time.  
- *(More scripts will be added soon to cover user input, file checking, and automation examples.)*

## ▶️ How to Use

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/starAwesome123/BashCode.git
cd bash-scripts-sample
```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x HelloBash.sh
